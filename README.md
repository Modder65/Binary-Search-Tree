# Binary-Search-Tree

## Introduction

This project is a JavaScript implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). A BST is a hierarchical data structure where each node has a value, and pointers to its left and right children. The primary operations performed on a BST include insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Features

- **Balanced Tree Construction**: Builds a balanced tree from an array.
- **Insertion, Deletion, and Search Operations**: Allows for adding, removing, and finding values.
- **Traversals**: Supports Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, and Level Order traversals.
- **Tree Balancing and Rebalancing**: Ensures that the tree remains balanced.
- **Node Depth and Height Calculation**: Calculates the depth and height of nodes.
- **Tree Visualization**: Includes a `prettyPrint` method for visualizing the tree structure.

## Testing

Includes a Jest test suite to ensure all methods of the Search Tree are functioning correctly.
